    """
    A manual implementation of Wells Wilder's RSI calculation as outlined in
    his 1978 book "New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems" which makes
    use of the Î±-1 Wilder Smoothing Method of calculating the average
    gains and losses across trading periods.

        data: List[float or int] - a collection of floating point values
